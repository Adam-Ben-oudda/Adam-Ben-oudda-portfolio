## 📌 KPI Configuration

Each KPI is defined using a structured schema:

```python
KPI(
    id="conversion_rate",
    name="Conversion Rate",
    unit="%",
    higher_is_better=True,
    min_value=0,
    max_value=100,
    weight=0.2,
    anomaly_threshold=2.0
)
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Run the Application

```bash
python business_kpi_dashboard.py
```

The system auto-ingests demo data, performs trend + anomaly analysis, and continuously refreshes in the background.
