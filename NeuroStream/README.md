# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Adam-Ben-oudda/NeuroStream.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd NeuroStream

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start streaming data processing
processor.start_stream(source="your_data_source")

# Optionally, listen for processed output
for output in processor.stream_output():
    print(output)
