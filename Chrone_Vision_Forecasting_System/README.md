Quick Start

from chronovision import ChronoVisionEngine, TemporalEvent, ChronoVisionVisualizer
import pandas as pd
import datetime

engine = ChronoVisionEngine()
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv', parse_dates=['date'])

engine.load_data(data, date_col='date', series_cols=['sales'], external_factors=['marketing_spend', 'competitor_price'])

black_friday = TemporalEvent(
    name='Black Friday',
    start_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 11, 24),
    end_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 11, 24),
    event_type='promotion',
    impact_scope={'sales': 1.5},
    description='Annual Black Friday sales surge'
)
engine.add_event(black_friday)

engine.train_models('sales')
forecast = engine.forecast('sales', horizon=90)

ChronoVisionVisualizer.plot_forecast(engine.data['sales'], forecast, title="Sales Forecast")

impact = engine.causal_impact_analysis('Black Friday', 'sales')
ChronoVisionVisualizer.plot_causal_impact(impact)

narrative = engine.generate_narrative('sales')
print(narrative)
